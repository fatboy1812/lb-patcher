II. KNOWN HARDWARE COMPATIBILITY ISSUES 
---------------------------------------


--------------------
Video-Related Issues
--------------------
      
If you have technical compatibility questions about Shadowbane after launch, it is advised that you visit our Technical Support bulletin boards.  These boards can be found at these locations
      PC:    http://ubbforums.ubi.com/postlist.php?Cat=&Board=sb_support_pc
      Mac:  http://ubbforums.ubi.com/postlist.php?Cat=&Board=sb_support_mac
      General: http://ubbforums.ubi.com/postlist.php?Cat=&Board=sb_support_gen
 
Only higher level graphics cards will be able to take advantage of the normal mapping/per pixel lighting solution implemented in Shadowbane.  All other cards will see this art without normal-mapping applied.  Supported cards include nVidia FX series and ATI Radeon 9500 and newer cards.  
 
Players with Mac versions below 10.2.8 may encounter difficulties.  It is recommended that any Mac users upgrade at least to Mac 10.2.8 in order to play Shadowbane.
 
-------
      
The ATI 3.1 Catalyst drivers seem to cause problems with alpha textures; Older drivers do not display this behavior. We recommend Catalyst 4.9.
 
Graphical errors can occur when Shadowbane is run at the same time as other applications that are set to execute always on top.
 
To maximize frame rate, set dynamic lighting to low (DYNAMICLIGHTING=0), turn off all shadows, reduce terrain detail level from 4 to 2 or lower, turn off normal mapping, reduce particle density, and reduce texture detail. Use the SBConfig.exe utility to change performance settings outside of the game.
 
If you log in to the game with lowered game resolution settings and then change them to higher resolution settings, it will drop your frame rate. The workaround is to exit Shadowbane after the settings take effect, then re-enter.
 
Parhelia(TM) graphic cards will crash the Shadowbane client unless meshcache=false in the Arcane Pref. 
 
Some older ATI drivers (below 4.6) will show a triangle shaped graphical anomaly above the characters head in certain zones (starburst effect).



----------------------
III. GAMEPLAY ISSUES
----------------------

Poison Blade and Consecrate weapon will not work unless the weapon is 'Identified'.

There appears to be an issue with guards not patrolling their patrol points.

Doors sometimes appear to be open when they are not, preventing you from entering a building.

If you die while casting a spell, that spell will not be usable until you relog.

Players sometimes will find they get stuck after teleporting into into a runegate.
 
Using a water bucket on a door will waste the water bucket.

Scrolls are always destroyed, even when the spell fails to go off. 

Mobs teleport around too often while chasing players.   

Long weapons such as pole arms can make a player 'hop' while running.

Monster AI text strings will not display if the player is too far away from the monster.

When a monster dies, it can fall into an object, making that monster unlootable.

In-Game Support Information
---------------------------
 
Any and all feedback, reports of problems, or other issues that you need to
communicate to the development team should be sent via the CCR (Customer
Care Representative) Petition system. To access the Petition menu,
left-click the Petition CCR button on the Info/Help sub-menu, located in the
Command Bar from within the game.
 
The CCR Petition window contains a menu of options, each of which will open
a specialized Petition window. The option buttons tag the petition, ensuring
that it is sent to the correct place. The options available are:
 
* General Help - A request for basic help in Shadowbane about anything
from the user Interface to gameplay and the default hotkeys. Questions
concerning the world of Shadowbane itself (Hints, game information, etc.)
will NOT be answered. Refer to the Shadowbane Web site,
http://shadowbane.com.
 
* Feedback - Opinions about gameplay and requests for enhancements.
 
* Stuck - A request to be freed if trapped inside an object.
 
* Harassment - Files a formal complaint about another player's actions.
 
* Abuse/Exploit - Reports a system bug that, if used, will give an unfair
advantage.
 
* Bug - Reports all other system or game problems.
 
* Game Stopper - Reports a cataclysmic fault or problem.
 
* Tech Support - A request for help dealing with computer-related issues.
 
 
Selecting a petition type on the Petition menu opens a Petition window,
where you can enter the details of your comments or problems. Petition
windows have the following features:
 
* Name - Your character's name is recorded automatically.
 
* Location - Your character's current location (in-world coordinates) is
recorded automatically.
 
* Zone - The name of the zone your character occupies is recorded
automatically.
 
* Instructions - A brief statement indicating how likely or how quickly a
CCR can directly respond to the problem. Response varies based on the type
of petition and other circumstances.
 
* Description Field - Input a detailed description of your problem,
comments, etc. in this area. Left-click in the field to place a cursor, then
type your description. The more descriptive and detailed the information 
is, the more able the development and support team will be to assist you
or solve the problem.
 
* Submit Button - The check-marked button at the bottom of the window
submits your petition.
 
* Cancel Button - The [X] button in the upper right corner closes the
Petition window and cancels the petition.
 
 
Players may not have more than one petition in the system. In order to send
an additional petition, the last one must be canceled (does not apply to bug
or feedback petitions).
